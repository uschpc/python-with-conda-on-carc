    "This module is based on the minimal Miniconda installer which includes the package and environment manager Conda that installs and updates packages and their dependencies. This module also provides Mamba, which is a drop-in replacement for most conda commands that enables faster package solving, downloading, and installing.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want a newer version of Conda or Mamba than what is available in the module, you can also install them into one of your directories. We recommend installing either [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).\n",
